## Websockets

  - What are WebSockets?
    - WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, low latency communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. WebSockets allow for real-time event based communication between a client and a server.

  - How is a Websocket connection estabilished?
    - A WebSocket connection begins with an HTTP handshake, where the client sends an HTTP request to the server with a special "Upgrade" header indicating the desire to establish a WebSocket connection. If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with a "101 Switching Protocols" status code, signaling the upgrade to the WebSocket protocol. Once the handshake is complete, both the client and server can exchange messages.

  - How does WebSocket communication works in web applications?
    - WebSockets enable real-time communication by allowing both the client and server to send and receive messages asynchronously without the overhead of traditional HTTP polling. This enables applications to push data from the server to the client instantly, facilitating live updates and interactive features without the need for constant client-initiated requests.

  - What are some common use cases for WebSockets in web applications?
    - Common use cases for WebSockets include chat applications, online gaming, live sports updates, collaborative editing tools, and financial trading platforms. Essentially, any application that requires real-time data synchronization or instant updates between clients and servers can benefit from WebSockets.

  - Commonly used Websocket libraries, what are they good for?
    - These libraries are useful because they abstract away much of the complexity of working directly with WebSocket connections, providing developers with higher-level APIs and additional features to build robust real-time applications more efficiently.

    - Socket.IO: Socket.IO is popular for its ease of use and cross-browser compatibility. It has many features like automatic reconnection, multiplexing, and broadcasting.

    - ws (WebSocket): ws is a lightweight WebSocket library for Node.js. It's known for its simplicity and high performance, making it suitable for building scalable real-time applications. It provides a low-level API for handling WebSocket connections, allowing developers full control over the WebSocket protocol implementation.

    - SockJS: SockJS is a WebSocket emulation library that falls back to other communication protocols like HTTP long polling or JSONP if WebSocket support is not available. It's useful for applications that need to support older browsers or environments where WebSocket connections might be restricted.
